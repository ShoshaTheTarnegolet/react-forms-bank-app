# React Bank Form Apllication

This is my React app for a test assignment.\
It's a simple web application, which interacts both with the client and the DB (I use Firebase DB since I'm more familiar with it).\

The application contains:

- login page for existing users (you can't make your own)
- information page, which user fills or edits and this info is saved into DB
- pages with cards, select and slider
- modal
- language selection (for now it's only on the login page). This app is in Hebrew, but I'll add English too

It doesnt't completely finished yet, there are things to do:

- improve my code, make it more simple, understandable and reusable
- get rid of Context and start to use Redux or Valtio
- make Modals for all pages
- remove problems with id, when refresh page
- make language change on all pages

For design I choose neumorphism. But I didn't finished design of whole app.\
I've deployed this app to firebase and you can use this [link](https://btbtest-assignment.firebaseapp.com/).\
You can use this passwords and ids:

- id 123 \ password 000
- id 1111 \ password 1111
- id 2525 \ password 2000
- id 4444 \ password 4444
