# Frontend Home Assignment

This is my app for this assignment. For design I choose neumorphism. It's really good looking with forms and buttons. This design is visually simple and makes people feel calm. Anyway a lot of time I was working on the code. and it took me a lot of time on the technical part of the assignment. So my design is a bit crude and I think it can be good to add a background to contrast it with a monochrome colors palette of neumorphism design.
As database I used Firestore, since for now I haven't a lot of experience with DB like SQL or Mongo. I've deployed the app to firebase and you use this [link](https://btbtest-assignment.firebaseapp.com/bank).
I used react-router-dom and one time Material UI for Select element.

You can use this passwords and ids:

- id 123 \ password 000
