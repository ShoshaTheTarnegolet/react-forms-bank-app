# Frontend Home Assignment

This is my app for this assignment. For design I choose neumorphism. It's really good looking with forms and buttons. This design is visually simple and makes people feel calm. Anyway basically I was working on the code. and it took me a lot of time on the technical part of the assignment. So my design is a bit crude and I think it can be good to add a background to contrast it with a monochrome colors palette of neumorphism design./
As database I used Firestore, since for now I haven't a lot of experience with DB like SQL or Mongo. I've deployed the app to firebase and you use this [link](https://btbtest-assignment.firebaseapp.com/)./
I used react-router-dom and one time Material UI for Select element./

You can use this passwords and ids:

- id 123 \ password 000
- id 1111 \ password 1111
- id 2525 \ password 2000
- id 4444 \ password 4444

- in medium screen buttons 'לקבל הלוואה' and 'להשקיע' overlap the main picture with woman, it looks weird./
- starting from screen-size 1489px and 1000px (when hamburger appears) links into nav move and it looks like this nav is not prepared for this size. Like missed one breakpoint./
- it's not easy to find where can I switch to English layout and I, as a person with not native Hebrew, can tell that I closed a lot websites only for a reason that there wasn't language toggle./
- thin light font - hard to read especially if you have vision problems/
- maybe remove standard scroll-bar to dot-navigation, for example. This site has a lot very good and different features: animation, video, chats, slider etc, and the look of this scroll-bar it's like from another opera. -https://www.btbisrael.co.il/get-loan/ - for example, on this page we see a yellow block under nav. but when we just open this page, there's no yellow block and we see body or container white white color background./
- great carousel of video and text swiper. very easy to use on any screen size and beautiful/
- also I think that coins animation with svg and clip-path also attracts attention and is great!/

- this page is looking great, just some pages don't fit viewport and therefore buttons move down and we should scroll to get them./
- error messages overlap main text and we can't see neither main text nor error. Maybe put error messages as helping text above input./
- on medium screen background pictures are overlapping with text blocks. Here it doesn't look well, because ther are pictures with people and it looks weird./
- on mobile screen information cards and cards with links almost don't have indention and some of this blocks have another size (just a fex pixels wider) and content overlaps other content/
